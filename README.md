# Indoor_Climate_Control_System

Project Introduction:

· Designing and implementing an indoor climate control and monitoring system 
using for testing reliability of bio-building-materials.
· The system can simulate the indoor environment, monitor the temperature and 
humidity in the air and the temperature and moisture of the walls made of biological building materials.
· The system can be controlled remotely and has wireless data transmission and 
storage functions
